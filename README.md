# Attendance Compiler for MS Teams

## Why
The generated attendance file from Microsoft Teams simply provides a log of the participants joining and leaving the meeting, along with their associated timestamps, as a CSV.  
&nbsp;  
For a classroom setting, however, it is often required to track a student's time-of-entry into the classroom, as well as their attendance duration, in order to determine whether credit for attendance should be disbursed or not.  
&nbsp;  
Similar use-cases may exist beyond the classroom.

## Usage
1. From a Microsoft Teams meeting, download the attendance CSV file from the Participants sidebar
2. Visit [this project's website](https://dhdhagar.github.io/msteams-attendance-compiler/), and set the configuration parameters
3. Drag-and-drop or click-to-upload the attendance file
4. The aggregated attendance file will then be downloaded
